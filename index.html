                    <h2>1898</h2>

                    <p>On the 13th June 1898, the history of Prince Edward School began in humble beginning by a body of
                        farsighted and
                        adventurous citizens, who at that time could not have seen that that little “acorn” would grow
                        into the mighty “oak.”

                        On that historic day in 1898, the forerunner of this famous old school was named ‘Salisbury
                        Public

                        Undenominational School’ by a committee which had been formed and who passed a resolution
                        charging that local architects
                        be invited to submit plans for the erection of a suitable school building to afford
                        Accommodation for the 75 pupils and
                        accommodation for a Master, and suitable offices.

                        The resolution implied that the Architect, Mr A C A Cator, should be given one month to submit
                        plans for the building
                        not to exceed £1 000 in cost, although the actual cost rose to $2 000, for a building comprising
                        one single classroom,
                        plus two small rooms, and verandah for the Headmaster. Prior to this, the British South Africa
                        Company had granted the
                        committee access to four acres of land in Moffat Street.

                        The Headmaster and a lady teacher were appointed by the Superintendent of Education in the Cape
                        Colony, at salaries of £
                        180 and £90 per annum respectively.

                        These two positions were filled by the first Headmaster, Mr John Kerr, and the first teacher Mrs
                        Garcia from South
                        Africa, who arrived by coach from Bulawayo, since the railway had not yet reached Salisbury.On
                        the 14th November 1898 in
                        midterm the Salisbury Public Undenominational School was opened, and it is interesting to
                        note that the first intake of 2 boys and 2 girls included such names as Vivian and Frank Pascoe.

                    <p>
                        1994 – Guest of Honour at the school’s annual Speech Day was Dr. T Samkange, while the school
                        achieved the best academic
                        results in nine years, with a 70% pass rate for the 220 candidates who wrote A Level.

                        1995 – Saw the launching of the Centennial Fund, with a visit to the school by HRH Prince Edward
                        on August 31.

                        1996 – First “colour” edition of the magazine.

                        1997 – 99th year of the school.

                        1998 – Centenary year 100 years of Prince Edward School.Gentlemen. As the School celebrates its
                        125th anniversary this
                        year it is worth remembering its rich history. Some of
                        its more memorable milestones are shown in the table below. The table covers the School’s first
                        100 years (from 1898 to
                        1998). It would be worthwhile for someone to update the table to include significant milestones
                        from the last 25 years.

            <h3 class="memory">Memories</h3>
            <p>Too many hundreds nay, thousands of Old Hararians throughout the world, the memory of their younger days
                especially
                school days, which was the bulk of their younger lives lingers ever in their memories, and
                reminiscences.

                Prince Edward School induces that line of thought, for school was their life, their being and their all.

                In fact in the words of the poets and intellectuals, school is a never forgotten factor, something to
                live for, to
                strive for and sometimes with their country to die for.

                The following poem by Sir Henry New bolt is reproduced in memory of their days at School.

                Prince Edward School ‘The Best School of All.The Best school of All.

                It’s good to see the school we knew,

                The land of youth and dream,

                To greet again the rule we knew,

                Before we took the stream,

                Through long we’ve missed the sight of her,

                Our hearts may not forget,

                We’ve lost the old delight of her,

                We keep her honors yet.

                Refrain: We’ll honor yet the school we knew,

                The best school of all,

                We’ll honor yet the rule we knew,

                Till the last bell call,

                For working days or holidays,

                And glad or melancholy days,

                They were great days and jolly days

                At the best School of all.

                The stars and sounding vanities

                That half the crowd Bewitch,

                What are they but inanities?

                To him that treads the pitch,

                And where’s the wealth, I’m wondering,

                Could buy the cheers that roll,

                When the last charge goes thundering,

                Beneath the twilight goal,

                The men that tanned the hide of us,

                Our daily foes and friends,

                They shall not lose their pride of us,

                However the journey ends.

                Their voice, to us who sing of it,

                No more its message bears,

                But the round world shall ring of it,

                And all we are is theirs.

                To speak of fame a venture is,

                There’s little here can abide,

                But we may face the centuries,

                And dare the deepening tide,

                For though the dust that’s part of us,

                To dust again be gone,

                Yet still shall beat the heart of us,

                The school we handed on.</p>
